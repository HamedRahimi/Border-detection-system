# Border-detection-system
In this scenario, we have designed a border detection system based on detecting RF signal power. We have designed an especial algorithm that connects every node to the all other nodes and by measuring some parameters can detect anything that crosses the border.
o Achieved Annual Award of Innovation and Entrepreneurship of SUIC. 
o Developed for Agriculture Engineering Department at Shiraz University.
o Designed to detect Border crossing based on measuring some parameters such as the power of RF signals.
